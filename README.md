# Django Admin Sortable

This project makes it easy to add drag-and-drop ordering to any model in
Django admin. Inlines for a sortable model may also be made sortable,
enabling individual items or groups of items to be sortable.

## Requirements
jQuery

## Supported Django Versions
If you're using Django 1.4.x, use django-admin-sortable 1.4.9 or below.
For Django 1.5.x, use the latest version of django-admin-sortable.

django-admin-sortable 1.5.2 introduced backward-incompatible changes for Django 1.4.x


## Installation
1. pip install django-admin-sortable

--or--

Download django-admin-sortable from [source](https://github.com/iambrandontaylor/django-admin-sortable/archive/master.zip)

1. Unzip the directory and cd into the uncompressed project directory
2. *Optional: Enable your virtualenv
3. Run `$ python setup.py install` or add `adminsortable` to your PYTHONPATH.


## Configuration
1. Add `adminsortable` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`.
2. Ensure `django.core.context_processors.static` is in your `TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS`.

### Static Media
Preferred:
Use the [staticfiles app](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/ref/contrib/staticfiles/)

Alternate:
Copy the `adminsortable` folder from the `static` folder to the
location you serve static files from.

### Testing
Have a look at the included sample_project to see working examples.
The login credentials for admin are: admin/admin

When a model is sortable, a tool-area link will be added that says "Change Order".
Click this link, and you will be taken to the custom view where you can drag-and-drop
the records into order.

Inlines may be drag-and-dropped into any order directly from the change form.


## Usage

### Models
To add sorting to a model, your model needs to inherit from `Sortable` and
have an inner Meta class that inherits from `Sortable.Meta`

    #models.py
    from adminsortable.models import Sortable

    class MySortableClass(Sortable):
        class Meta(Sortable.Meta):
            pass

        title = models.CharField(max_length=50)

        def __unicode__(self):
            return self.title


It is also possible to order objects relative to another object that is a ForeignKey,
even if that model does not inherit from Sortable:

    from adminsortable.fields import SortableForeignKey

    #models.py
    class Category(models.Model):
        title = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        ...

    class Project(Sortable):
        class Meta(Sortable.Meta):
            pass

        category = SortableForeignKey(Category)
        title = models.CharField(max_length=50)

        def __unicode__(self):
            return self.title


Sortable has one field: `order` and adds a default ordering value set to `order`.

### Adding Sortable to an existing model
If you're adding Sorting to an existing model, it is recommended that you use [django-south](http://south.areacode.com/) to create a schema migration to add the "order" field to your model. You will also need to create a data migration in order to add the appropriate values for the `order` column.

Example assuming a model named "Category":

    def forwards(self, orm):
        for index, category in enumerate(orm.Category.objects.all()):
            category.order = index + 1
            category.save()

See: [this link](http://south.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial/part3.html) for more
information on Data Migrations.


### Django Admin Integration
To enable sorting in the admin, you need to inherit from `SortableAdmin`:

    from django.contrib import admin
    from myapp.models import MySortableClass
    from adminsortable.admin import SortableAdmin

    class MySortableAdminClass(SortableAdmin):
        """Any admin options you need go here"""

    admin.site.register(MySortableClass, MySortableAdminClass)


To enable sorting on TabularInline models, you need to inherit from
SortableTabularInline:

    from adminsortable.admin import SortableTabularInline

    class MySortableTabularInline(SortableTabularInline):
       """Your inline options go here"""


To enable sorting on StackedInline models, you need to inherit from
SortableStackedInline:

    from adminsortable.admin import SortableStackedInline

    class MySortableStackedInline(SortableStackedInline):
       """Your inline options go here"""


There are also generic equivalents that you can inherit from:

    from adminsortable.admin import (SortableGenericTabularInline,
        SortableGenericStackedInline)
        """Your generic inline options go here"""


### Overriding `queryset()`
django-admin-sortable now supports custom queryset overrides on admin models
and inline models in Django admin!

If you're providing an override of a SortableAdmin or Sortable inline model,
you don't need to do anything extra. django-admin-sortable will automatically
honor your queryset.

Have a look at the WidgetAdmin class in the sample project for an example of
an admin class with a custom `queryset()` override.

#### Overriding `queryset()` for an inline model
This is a special case, which requires a few lines of extra code to properly
determine the sortability of your model. Example:

    # add this import to your admin.py
    from adminsortable.utils import get_is_sortable


    class ComponentInline(SortableStackedInline):
        model = Component

        def queryset(self, request):
            qs = super(ComponentInline, self).queryset(request).filter(
                title__icontains='foo')

            # You'll need to add these lines to determine if your model
            # is sortable once we hit the change_form() for the parent model.

            if get_is_sortable(qs):
                self.model.is_sortable = True
            else:
                self.model.is_sortable = False
            return qs

If you override the queryset of an inline, the number of objects present
may change, and adminsortable won't be able to automatically determine
if the inline model is sortable from here, which is why we have to set the
`is_sortable` property of the model in this method.

#### Extending custom templates
By default, adminsortable's change form and change list views inherit from
Django admin's standard templates. Sometimes you need to have a custom change
form or change list, but also need adminsortable's CSS and JavaScript for
inline models that are sortable for example.

SortableAdmin has two properties you can override for this use case:

    change_form_template_extends
    change_list_template_extends

These properties have default values of:

    change_form_template_extends = 'admin/change_form.html'
    change_list_template_extends = 'admin/change_list.html'


#### A Special Note About Stacked Inlines...
The height of a stacked inline model can dynamically increase,
which can make them difficult to sort. If you anticipate the height of a
stacked inline is going to be very tall, I would suggest using
TabularStackedInline instead.


### Known Issue(s)
Because of the way inline models are added to their parent model in the
change form, it is not currently possible to have sortable inline models
whose parent does not inhert from `Sortable`, without adding the necessary
JavaScript and CSS files to the change form manually.

Example:

    class GalleryImageInline(SortableTabularInline):
        model = GalleryImage  # inherits from Sortable

    class GalleryAlbumAdmin  # GalleryAlbum does not inherit Sortable
        class Media:
            js = (
                    '//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js',
                    '//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.10.2/jquery-ui.min.js',
                    # 'adminsortable/js/admin.sortable.stacked.inlines.js',
                    'adminsortable/js/admin.sortable.tabular.inlines.js',
                )
            css = {
                'screen': ('adminsortable/css/admin.sortable.inline.css', ),
            }


### Rationale
Other projects have added drag-and-drop ordering to the ChangeList
view, however this introduces a couple of problems...

- The ChangeList view supports pagination, which makes drag-and-drop
ordering across pages impossible.
- The ChangeList view by default, does not order records based on a
foreign key, nor distinguish between rows that are associated with a
foreign key. This makes ordering the records grouped by a foreign key
impossible.
- The ChangeList supports in-line editing, and adding drag-and-drop
ordering on top of that just seemed a little much in my opinion.

### Status
